This project uses numpy library to create student and subject matrix with grades. 
It finds:
        Student which has the highest average score;
        Student with the highest score in mathematics;
        Student with the lowest score in mathematics;
        Students whose English score is greater than the average English score.
I also used tabulate library that creates visually appealing and well-formatted table.
